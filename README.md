# 2022 Coding Project

In order not to lose practice on coding interview problems, I decided to do at least one Leetcode exercise a day, starting 01/30/22. In this repo you can find all the Leetcode exercises I finished so far. Hope it helps you somehow. :wink:

**Suggestions on code improvement are always welcome!**

_PS.: The names of the files are the Leetcode numbers for the questions._
