# 2022 Coding Project

In order not to lose practice on coding interview problems, I decided to try doing one Leetcode exercise a day, starting 30/01/2022. In this repo you can find all the Leetcode exercises I finished this year. Hope it helps you somehow. :wink:

**Suggestions on code improvement are always welcome!**

_PS.: The names of the files are the Leetcode numbers for the questions._
